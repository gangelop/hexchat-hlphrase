# hexchat-hlphrase

This is a python script for hexchat. It allows you to highlight entire phrases instead of just single words.

## Usage
Use like any other python script. Just copy it to the hexchat addons dir, for example `~/.config/hexchat/addons/hlphrase.py`. Also, make a list of phrases you want to be highlighted and put it in `~/config/hexchat/hlphrase.conf`.

## Disclaimer

I am not the original author of this script. I adapted the script from another one written for xchat. It was used internally in the company I work for. I don't know if it exists anywhere publicly. If I find out, I'll update this.
